## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to political science, economics, and sports. I have a lot of ideas related to sports. I might look into the home court advantage in professional sports; this is my favorite idea. I could also look into salary caps in the NBA: how does the distribution of player salaries within a team affect its performance in the NBA? Another idea -- what is the short-term and long-term economic impact on cities that host major sports events, like the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup?
